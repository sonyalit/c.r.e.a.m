### c.r.e.a.m. is a personal expense tracker developed with react/effector on the client and nest on the server.
It was inspired by the tutorial on this [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TntnOmZ-yp8).

If you want to do some mental damage and calculate your expenses please follow these steps:
1. cd /server/cash
2. npm ci
3. create .env with your MongoDb DATABASE_URL and DATABASE_NAME
4. npm start 
5. cd ../../client/cash
6. npm ci
7. create .env with your server REACT_APP_SERVER_URL
8. npm start

Since I am sort of a investor myself I plan to play with Tinkoff Invest API in the near future. Stay tuned.

PS. Barbie core is not over yet
